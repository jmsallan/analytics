Activity 01: Analysing Data
===

Context and justification

One of the most common tasks in the engineering management is to analyse huge quantities of data with the goal of understand what’s happening and taking an optimal, data-driven decision. The objective of this activity is to develop a data analysis project, using data from and Open Data platform.

Description

The activity consists in analysing 4 data-files (with their corresponding descriptions) from Barcelona's City Hall Open Data Service, in order to develop new strategies to promote commercial development in the neighbourhoods. 

The final deliverable is a report where each group will have to report their analysis and their main conclusiones. 

Expected time to do the activity: 8 hours (4 hours in the classroom)

Deliverables

Each group has to upload a single file in pdf format to the platform ATENEA. The deadline is September 28, 2019 (23:55 UTC/GMT +1 hour). The name of the file will be: ’2019-ACT01-TfDMX.pdf’. 

Grading

The grade of the activity depends on three elements:

The level of difficulty of the analysis.
The accuracy and quality of description of the analysis.
The quality of structure and content of the report.

Activity 2: Data reading and handling
===

Context and Justification
---

Managing (reading and handling) data is the first step to analyze it and to obtain interesting results. 

 
Description
---

TThe first step is to read the file *bank.csv* into R. In the resulting data frame, each row represents a customer. This activity has two parts:

The first part of the activity consists in answering the following questions using only functions of R:

1. How many customers/cases does the dataset have?
2. How many variables does the data frame have?
3. How many different marital status are there in the data frame? 
4. How many unemployed customers are there in the data frame?
5. Which is the average age of the unemployed customers?
6. How many customers NOT unemployed are there in the data frame?
7. Which is the average age of the customers who has a personal loan and the average yearly balance is lower than 1,000 euros?
8. Which are the 4 entrepreneur customers with a personal loan with the highest balance?
9. Which are the 4 student customers younger than 24 years old with the lowest balance?
10. If we consider that the quality of a customer is the balance times the duration divided by the number of campaigns. Which is the customer with the highest quality score? 
11. Group the customers by job and obtain the mean values for int variables.

The second part of the activity is to write a report explaining how you have answered the questions using R.

Expected time to do the activity: 2 hours

Context and Justification
Plots are one of the most useful techniques in an exploratory data analysis. 
Description
The activity will be developed by groups of no more than three students. The first step is to read the file *bank.csv*. The activity has 2 parts:
The first part consists in finding the adequate plots which help us to understand the differences between the types of customers in the data set. Types of customers can be age, job, marital status and any other variable in which customers can be classified. We are interested to find differences among groups in variables such as balance, loan, default and any other variable related to the relationship between the bank and the customer. Please look at the appendix to check for the meaning of the variables.

DEA-A06: Module 01 - Activity 06
Activity 6: merging data frames
Context and Justification
It’s very common to find our information in different data frames following a relational database structure, so we have to merge in just one in order to simplify our analysis.
Description
The activity will be developed by groups of no more than three students. The activity has the following steps:
1. Read the files *flights.csv*, *airports.csv*, and *airlines.csv*, solving any problem you may find in the reading process.
2. Substitute the "two letter carrier abbreviation" in the data frame *flights* by the full name that you can find in the data frame *airlines*.
3. Create a new variable which encodes a given hour and minute as one decimal number, i.e. timeInHours (4 hours and 15 minutes will become 4.25). Save this new variable as variable *time* in the data frame *flights*.
4. Calculate the average arrival delay per each month.
5. Consider only the flights with positive values in the arrival delay (arr_delay). Calculate the average arrival delay per each month.
6. Finally, write a report using rmarkdown. The report has to show step by step what you have done and the results.
Expected time to do the activity: 2 hour 
Deliverables
Each group needs to upload a single file in Rmd format to the platform ATENEA. The deadline is October 19, 2019 (23:55 UTC/GMT +1 hour). The name of the file will be: ’2019-ACT05-GroupX.Rmd’, where X is the letter of the group.

DEA-A2: Module 01 - Activity 07

Activity 7: Clustering cases
Context and Justification
Clustering is a business analytics technique that help us to group observations into clusters. Observations belonging to a cluster will be close to each other, according to a definition of distance.
Description
The activity will be developed by groups of no more than three students. The first step is to read the file *bank.csv*. The activity has 2 parts:
The first part of the activity consists in testing if the classification by type of customer explains the values of the variables in the dataset according to a hierarchical clustering and a k-means clustering. Remember that (1) we can use the function ‘mutate’ to add new variables based on the rest of variables, you don't need to include all variables in the clustering process. 
The second part of the activity is to write a report using rmarkdown, with the selected plots embedded. The report has to show step by step what you have done, the results and a justification.
Expected time to do the activity: 2 hours.
Deliverables
Each group need to upload a single file in Rmd format to the platform ATENEA. The deadline is October 22, 2019 (23:55 UTC/GMT +1 hour). The name of the file will be: ’2019-ACT07-inGroup.Rmd’.
